Simple Java Swing quiz app

Quizzer47 is a straightforward application that provides users with the means to take quizzes and test their knowledge. 
It utilizes Java's swing library to achieve this, and I designed it with the intention of separating the component classes

The project was a final for CS 3330: Object Oriented Programming, which was a course I took at Mizzou in the Fall of 2022.
